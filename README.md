# Data-Science_-Air-Quality-Index-Prediction-in-Bishkek
The projects aims at predicting the air quality index, based on PM2.5 and PM10 levels, temperature, NO2 gas level on the air, atmospheric pressure and the humidity via different supervised Machine Learning algorithms. 
The data for the project was taken from http://data.movegreen.kg/ , which is an open-source website that provides data for environmental research purposes. 
The project considers two scenarios with different train and test splits. In the first scenario, data was split to train and test by random shufflign to 80% and 20%, respectively. In the second scenario, it was made sure that the data was stplit equally by every season: 80% of each season go to training data, while the remaning 20% of each season go to testing data.
Each notebook contains the code with the necessary description.
